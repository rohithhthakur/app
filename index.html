Great to hear that the updated code snippet provided the exact error information you needed! Hereâ€™s a summary of the changes made and why they were effective, which you can share with your team:

### Key Changes Made

1. **Using `subprocess.Popen` with `stdout` and `stderr` Capturing**:
   - Previously, it might have been that only `stderr` was being captured, or output was not being redirected properly. By explicitly directing both `stdout` and `stderr` to `subprocess.PIPE`, we ensured that all output from the command (both standard output and errors) is captured by the Python script.
   - This allows you to see everything the script outputs, including errors that might help diagnose issues.

2. **Introduction of `communicate()` Method**:
   - The `communicate()` method waits for the process to finish and reads the output from `stdout` and `stderr` completely. This method helps to avoid deadlocks that can occur from the pipe filling up.
   - `communicate()` returns a tuple of `stdout` and `stderr`, allowing you to handle and analyze both separately after the process ends.

3. **Error Handling via Return Code Check**:
   - Checking `result.returncode` to determine if the command executed successfully (a return code of `0` typically indicates success in Unix-like systems). If the return code is not `0`, the script now prints the error output and raises an exception.
   - This structured approach to error handling ensures that any failure in the subprocess is not just logged, but also actively reported, making it easier to notice and react to failures.

### Why These Changes Are Effective

- **Complete Output Capture**: By capturing both `stdout` and `stderr`, the script doesn't miss any output that could indicate what went wrong in cases of errors or unexpected behaviors.
- **Prevention of Deadlocks**: Using `communicate()` instead of reading from `stdout` and `stderr` directly helps prevent the script from hanging due to unhandled output buffer overflows.
- **Clear Error Signaling**: By raising an exception when an error occurs (non-zero return code), the script makes it clear that an error condition was met, which is crucial for debugging and for

    except s3.exceptions.NoSuchKey:

# Usage
bucket_name = 'your-bucket-name'
object_key = 'your-object-key'
metadata = get_s3_object_metadata(bucket_name, object_key)
if metadata:
    print(metadata)
