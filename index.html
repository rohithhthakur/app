To perform a root cause analysis (RCA) on the data movement in your AWS S3 storage and understand the related cost implications, you can follow these steps:

### 1. Quantify the Data Movement
First, calculate the difference in storage between the two dates for each tier:

- **IAS (Infrequent Access Storage)**
  - 16th Feb: 107 TB
  - 17th Feb: 68 TB
  - **Change: 107 TB - 68 TB = 39 TB decreased**

- **FA (Frequent Access)**
  - 16th Feb: 143 TB
  - 17th Feb: 871 TB
  - **Change: 871 TB - 143 TB = 728 TB increased**

- **AIA (Archive Infrequent Access)**
  - 16th Feb: 1.78 PB
  - 17th Feb: 1.1 PB
  - **Change: 1.78 PB - 1.1 PB = 0.68 PB decreased** (1 PB = 1000 TB, hence 680 TB decreased)

### 2. Analyze How the Data Moved
To determine how data was moved between these tiers, consider the following:
- **Automated Lifecycle Policies**: Check if there are any lifecycle rules configured in S3 that automatically move data between these storage classes based on age, access patterns, or other criteria.
- **Manual Interventions**: Check logs for any manual operations or scripts/API calls that might have triggered data movement.
- **Application Behavior**: Applications interfacing with S3 might have operations embedded that cause data to move or replicate.

### 3. Investigate Cost Implications
- **Cost of Storage**: Different S3 storage classes have different pricing. Moving data to a higher-cost storage class will increase costs.
- **Data Transfer Costs**: Moving data between tiers incurs costs, especially if done across regions or out of AWS.
- **Operations Costs**: LIST, GET, PUT, and other S3 operations have associated costs which can add up significantly with large volumes of data.

### 4. Steps to Mitigate Cost
- **Review and Optimize Lifecycle Policies**: Ensure that lifecycle policies align with your actual data usage patterns and business requirements.
- **Set Up Alerts**: Use AWS CloudWatch to monitor S3 usage and set alarms for unexpected increases in data storage or transfer.
- **Implement Data Management Policies**: Regularly review data access patterns and storage needs. Delete unnecessary data and archive data that doesn't need frequent access.
- **Educate and Monitor**: Make sure all team members are aware of the costs associated with data storage and movement. Regularly audit access and transfer logs.

### 5. How to Get Notified of Data Movement
- **AWS CloudWatch Alarms**: Set up alarms to notify you when there are significant changes in data stored in S3 buckets or when data transfer metrics exceed certain thresholds.
- **AWS S3 Event Notifications**: Configure to receive notifications when objects are created, modified, or deleted in S3.
- **AWS Budgets**: Create a budget to manage costs associated with S3 and receive alerts when usage is likely to exceed set budget amounts.

### Implementing the RCA
- **Gather Data**: Collect data from AWS S3, AWS CloudTrail, and other relevant logs.
- **Analysis**: Use the data to pinpoint the exact cause and timing of the unexpected data movement.
- **Reporting**: Document the findings, including detailed explanations and data visualizations, to communicate with your team.

By following these steps, you can perform a thorough RCA, understand why your S3 costs increased, and take appropriate measures to prevent unwanted expenses in the future.
