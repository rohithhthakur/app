ðŸš¨ **Announcement: Mock Failover Event** ðŸš¨

Dear Team,

We will be performing a mock failover event to the West region scheduled for 6 PM today. This is a practice run, and we plan to revert back to the East region by tomorrow morning before business hours.

Please note that this activity will affect DAGs that are running during the mock event. Therefore, any runs that start after 6 PM might be impacted.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Best regards,  
[Your Name / Team Name]
