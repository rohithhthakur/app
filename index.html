To adapt the `validate` function to your specifications, we need to adjust its logic so that for each group of datasets with the same name (e.g., "overlays" with multiple dataset IDs), it treats the group as passing if at least one dataset passes schema validation and then proceeds to rule validation, also considering the group as passing if at least one dataset passes rule validation. Hereâ€™s how you can implement this logic:

```python
def validate(self, inputs: List[InputObj]) -> List[OutputObj]:
    outputs = []
    name_dataset_map = {}  # Group datasets by name
    
    # Group inputs by name
    for input_obj in inputs:
        name_dataset_map.setdefault(input_obj.name, []).append(input_obj)
    
    # Process each group
    for name, dataset_group in name_dataset_map.items():
        schema_passed = False
        rules_passed = False
        valid_dataset_rule_results = []  # To store the successful rule validation results

        for dataset in dataset_group:
            if dataset.value is None or dataset.dataset_id is None:
                continue  # Skip datasets with missing data or ID
            
            # Perform schema validation
            schema = self.get_schema(dataset.dataset_id)
            schema_validation_results = self.validate_schema(schema, dataset.value)
            
            # If schema validation fails, continue to the next dataset in the group
            if schema_validation_results:
                continue
            
            # At this point, schema validation has passed for the current dataset
            schema_passed = True
            
            # Perform rules validation
            rules = self.get_rules(dataset.dataset_id)
            rules_validation_results = self.validate_rules(rules, dataset.value, name)
            
            # Check if the current dataset passes rule validation
            if all(result.result for result in rules_validation_results):
                rules_passed = True
                valid_dataset_rule_results.extend(rules_validation_results)
                break  # Since one dataset passed both validations, no need to check further
            
        # After checking all datasets in the group
        if schema_passed and rules_passed:
            # If at least one dataset in the group passed both schema and rule validations
            outputs.extend(valid_dataset_rule_results)  # Only append successful rule validation results
        elif not schema_passed:
            # If no dataset in the group passed schema validation
            outputs.append(OutputObj(False, name + " Schema Validation", "Schema validation failed for all datasets."))
        elif not rules_passed:
            # If schema passed but rules failed for all datasets
            outputs.append(OutputObj(False, name + " Rules Validation", "Rules validation failed for all datasets."))

    return outputs
```

### Explanation:

1. **Grouping by Name:** Datasets are first grouped by their name to process datasets with multiple dataset IDs together.

2. **Schema Validation:** For each dataset in a group, it attempts schema validation. The process stops at the first dataset that passes schema validation, marking the group as having passed schema validation.

3. **Rule Validation:** If a dataset passes schema validation, it proceeds to rule validation. Similar to schema validation, the group is considered to have passed rule validation if at least one dataset passes all rule validations.

4. **Result Handling:**
    - If at least one dataset passes both schema and rule validations, only the successful rule validation results are extended to the `outputs`.
    - If no dataset in the group passes schema validation, a single `OutputObj` indicating failure in schema validation is appended to `outputs`.
    - If schema validation passes for at least one dataset but rule validation fails for all, a single `OutputObj` indicating failure in rule validation is appended.

This approach follows your requirement to consider a group (datasets under the same name) as passing if at least one of its datasets passes both schema and rule validations, prioritizing the passage of one dataset as indicative of the group's overall success.
