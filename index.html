Sure, let's go through a concrete example to illustrate how the deployment stages and version stages are mapped and executed in parallel using the Jenkins Groovy script. We'll use two hypothetical models, "model_a" and "model_b", each with two versions.

### Example Setup:
- **Models Directory Contains**:
  - `model_a` with versions `1.0` and `1.1`
  - `model_b` with versions `2.0` and `2.1`
- **Parameter Settings**:
  - `ModelName = "All"`
  - `Version = "All"`

### Step-by-Step Mapping and Execution:

#### 1. **Initialization of Stages Map**:
   - `def deployStages = [:]`
   - This creates an empty map to store the deployment stages for each model.

#### 2. **Iterate Over Each Model**:
   - Models found: `model_a` and `model_b`.

#### 3. **Create Deployment Stages for Each Model**:
   - **For `model_a`**:
     - `deployStages["Deploy model_a"] = { ... }`
   - **For `model_b`**:
     - `deployStages["Deploy model_b"] = { ... }`

#### 4. **Define Deployment Steps Inside Each Model's Closure**:
   - Inside each model's deployment closure, define steps for each version.

#### 5. **Initialize and Map Version Stages**:
   - **For `model_a`**:
     - `def versionStages = [:]`
     - Versions found: `1.0`, `1.1`.
     - Add stages:
       - `versionStages["model_a - Version 1.0"] = { ... }`
       - `versionStages["model_a - Version 1.1"] = { ... }`
   - **For `model_b`**:
     - `def versionStages = [:]`
     - Versions found: `2.0`, `2.1`.
     - Add stages:
       - `versionStages["model_b - Version 2.0"] = { ... }`
       - `versionStages["model_b - Version 2.1"] = { ... }`

#### 6. **Parallel Execution of Version Stages Within Each Model**:
   - Each version deployment of `model_a` and `model_b` is set to run in parallel.
   - For `model_a`:
     - `parallel versionStages` will concurrently execute the jobs for versions `1.0` and `1.1`.
   - For `model_b`:
     - Similarly, `parallel versionStages` will concurrently execute the jobs for versions `2.0` and `2.1`.

#### 7. **Parallel Execution of All Model Deployment Stages**:
   - `parallel deployStages` will concurrently execute the deployment for `model_a` and `model_b`.
   - This means that while `model_a` versions `1.0` and `1.1` are being deployed in parallel, `model_b` versions `2.0` and `2.1` are also deployed in parallel, but independently of `model_a`.

### How Parallel Jobs Work:
- **Jenkins Execution**:
  - Jenkins manages the execution of these parallel stages using its executors. Each parallel task is assigned to an executor, which runs the task independently.
- **Resource Utilization**:
  - The parallel execution ensures optimal utilization of available Jenkins executors, reducing the total deployment time by running multiple tasks simultaneously.
- **Task Scheduling**:
  - Jenkins schedules these tasks based on the availability of executors. If there are not enough executors available, some tasks will wait in the queue.

### Conclusion:
In this setup, the script effectively manages multiple deployments by allowing different versions of a model to deploy concurrently and independently of other models. This approach maximizes the efficiency of the deployment process, especially beneficial in environments with multiple models and frequent updates.
