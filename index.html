Here's a draft for your Slack message:

Hi Team,

During our pre-prod event, we encountered some issues which resulted in tasks getting queued up. Here are the problems we identified:

1. **Dagger Scheduler**: It wasn't coming up due to a missing environment variable for Redis.
2. **Virtuoso Workers**: These were unhealthy because of misconfigured proxy variables in the worker Docker image.
   - **Resolution**: We managed to bring up the workers healthily by adding the necessary proxy environment variables in the task definition.
3. **Task Queues**: Tasks were getting queued up because the workers couldnâ€™t connect to the Redis cluster due to missing security group rules on port 6379.
   - **Todo**: We need to work with the SRE team to update the security group rules.

Thank you, J and Nick, for your support in identifying and resolving the issues during Mock Trex.

Next Steps:
- Follow up with the Dagger team to schedule another mock dry run.
- We still need to determine if we are going to stay on the West post-mock or fall back to the East.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
